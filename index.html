        <h3 class="card-title">What is a digital twin?</h3>
        <p class="card-content">
          A "digital twin" is a virtual copy of something from the real world, such as a machine, a car, or even a part of the human body. Imagine it as an exact computerized version of something that exists in reality.
        </p>
        <p class="card-content">
          Imagine you have a car. A digital twin of that car would be a computer simulation that mimics all the details of the car, such as its shape, engine operation, wheels, and so on. This simulation is so accurate that you can use the digital twin to test how the car would behave in different situations, such as driving on different roads or in various weather conditions, without actually leaving your home.

        <h3 class="card-title">Why simulate?</h3>
        <p class="card-content">
          Testing and analyzing real-life situations in real scenarios requires a lot of investment, both financially and in terms of time, not to mention the limitations of resources for testing, the so-called "guinea pigs."
        </p>
        <p class="card-content">
          By using simulations of digital twins, we can elevate testing to higher levels of quality, since the simulated object closely resembles its real "twin." It is possible to carry out tests in various scenarios, whether in space, on other planets, or on Earth.

        <h3 class="card-title">What do we solve?</h3>
        <p class="card-content">
          Our project provides tangible solutions that save on logistics costs, preparation for testing in space/environmental scenarios, and also deliver more productivity and availability to users. In addition to requiring less investment, it consumes much less time to be completed.

        Orbit Worm is a specialized application that focuses exclusively on simulating the nervous system of C. elegans in a three-dimensional space environment. By using the C302 framework from the OpenWorm Project, the software offers a precise visual representation of the worm's nervous system in a spatial context.
